Positioner
==========

jQuery plugin for randomly sizing and positioning DOM elements. It's like the anti-masonry.

##	About

Positioner does the following:
1	Collect a set of DOM elements within the parent element
2	Resize the each element to a random available size
3	Position each element randomly within the parent element

##	Docs

Positioner has no documentation yet, but it's in-progress. Gotta get its parent project shipped first though.

## License
Released under the MIT license. If you use it, it's cool if you'd let me know about it though.
