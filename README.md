Positioner does the following:
1	Collect a set of DOM elements within the parent element
2	Resize the each element to a random available size
3	Position each element randomly within the parent element

Check out a basic usage example at the (http://dfarnsworth.github.com/Positioner/)[Positioner github page].

Positioner has no documentation yet, but it's in-progress. Gotta get its parent project shipped first.
